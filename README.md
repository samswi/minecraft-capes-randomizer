# Minecraft capes randomizer
Fabric mod for people who can't choose their favorite minecraft cape

This very simple fabric mod utilizes [Mojang API](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mojang_API) to fetch capes the logged in player owns, and then equips a random one every time player disconnects from a server.
